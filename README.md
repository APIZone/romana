# The Romana Project

Romana is a new Software Defined Network (SDN) solution specifically designed
for the Cloud Native architectural style. The result of this focus is that
Romana cloud networks are less expensive to build, easier to operate and
deliver higher performance than cloud networks built using alternative SDN
designs.

##  Getting Started

To get started with Romana running on Devstack, some scripts and Ansible
playbooks have been provided to automate the setup and deployment, using
[Amazon EC2 Instances](#romana-on-amazon-ec2-instances) or
local [Virtualbox VMs](#romana-on-virtualbox-vms).
The scripts and playbooks are located in this repository.
They will access other repositories to download required pieces of the Romana system,
as well as some binaries we have already pre-compiled for your convenience.

The setup described below has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, but should work
similarly on other Linux or Mac OS X environments.

## Romana on Amazon EC2 Instances

Before you start, you will need to install the appropriate tools, and configure your EC2 SSH key and AWS credentials.

### Prerequisites

**Installing packages**

This setup requires ansible v1.9.3+ and boto. It is generally best to install these via python's ``pip`` tool.
```bash
sudo apt-get install git python-pip python-dev
sudo pip install ansible==1.9.4 boto awscli netaddr
```

**SSH key for access to EC2 instances**

This setup expects your EC2 Private Key in `~/.ssh/ec2_id_rsa`

**Setting up AWS tools**

Configure awscli with your AWS Credentials.
```sh-session
$ aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: A*******************
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: ****************************************
Default region name [None]: us-west-1
Default output format [None]: 
```
*Note:* The credentials provided should permit the creation of AWS resources such as EC2 instances, VPCs and so on.
Ensure the IAM user or role for these credentials has permission to create these AWS resources.

*Note:* The installation currently expects region ``us-west-1``, and might not work in other regions.
This will be addressed in the future.


### Installation

Check out Romana repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/romana/romana
cd romana/romana-install
```

Edit the `group_vars/aws` file to specify the appropriate EC2 Key Name.
Eg: change the `key_name` item from `shared-key-1` to the name you have configured.
You can check the name in AWS by opening the EC2 dashboard, and selecting "Key Pairs" to see your list of Key pair names.

Run the installer. This will create the Devstack cluster, install and activate Romana Cloud-Native tools.
```bash
./romana-setup
```

See details below about [using the system](#using-the-system) after the installation has completed.
And [contact us](#getting-help) for more information or assistance.

*Note:* By default, the stack name will be your username.
If you prefer to use a different name for the stack, you can override this by providing an extra option when launching:
```bash
./romana-setup install -e stack_name=xyz
```
The name should be a single word, and only contain letters and numbers. (No hyphens, underscores, etc.)

The EC2 installation takes 20-25 mins to complete (on t2.large instances) and creates an OpenStack DevStack cluster (Liberty release) with a single Controller Node and up to 4 Compute Nodes. Each OpenStack Node runs on a dedicated EC2 instance. Romana installs its OpenStack ML2 and IPAM drivers and creates a Romana router gateway interface on each Compute Node.


### Teardown

To uninstall, use the 'uninstall' subcommand.
```bash
./romana-setup uninstall
```

## Romana on Virtualbox VMs

You may wish to deploy this environment on your local machine using Virtualbox.
Approximately 5GB of available RAM is required, mainly due to the Devstack Controller instance needing 4GB to function.

### Prerequisites

**Installing packages**

This setup requires recent versions of
- [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

Also required are Ansible and the netaddr module. It is generally best to install these via python's ``pip`` tool.
```bash
sudo apt-get install git python-pip python-dev
sudo pip install ansible==1.9.4 netaddr
```

Ensure the `vagrant` command can be run without specifying its full path.
```sh-session
$ type -P vagrant
/usr/local/bin/vagrant
```

### Installation

Check out Romana repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/romana/romana
cd romana/romana-install
```

Run the installer. This will create the Devstack cluster, install and activate Romana Cloud-Native tools.

```bash
./romana-setup -t vagrant
```

Installation will take a while, due to some large downloads, and long installation steps. Please be patient.

You might want to take a [snapshot](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch01.html#snapshots) of the VMs at this stage.

### Teardown

To uninstall, use the 'uninstall' subcommand.
```bash
./romana-setup -t vagrant uninstall
```

## Using The System

At the end of installation, you should see a summary containing the URL of the dashboard,
and SSH commands to use to connect to the instances.

Other things you may wish to do:
- launch an instance using Horizon:
  * Log into the dashboard using username `admin` and password `secrete` (or the password you configured before installation)
  * Select `Instances` from the `Project/Compute` sidebar
  * Click the `Launch Instance` button
  * Provide the required details
  * Optionally, select the Advanced tab and specify a segment name in the `Romana Network Segment` field
  * Click the Launch button
- launch an instance using command-line: `nova boot --flavor m1.nano --image cirros-0.3.4-x86_64-uec --nic net-id=$(neutron net-show romana -Fid -f value) --meta romanaSegment=default instance-name`
- connect to the instance: `ssh cirros@instance-ip`
- install an ubuntu image:
  * Create a new flavor with RAM:512MB, Disk: 3GB, VCPUs: 1: `nova flavor-create m1.smallish auto 512 3 1`
  * Download a suitable image: `wget https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/releases/14.04.3/release/ubuntu-14.04-server-cloudimg-amd64-disk1.img`
  * Create image: `glance image-create --visibility public --disk-format qcow2 --container-format bare --name "ubuntu" < ubuntu-14.04-server-cloudimg-amd64-disk1.img`
- register a new host: on the controller, run `romana add-host <hostname> <host-ip> <romana-cidr> <agent-port>`
- add a new tenant: on the controller, run `romana create-tenant <tenant-name>`
- add a new segment: on the controller, run `romana add-segment <tenant-name> <segment-name>`
- see a list of tenants: `romana show-tenant`, details for a specific tenant: `romana show-tenant <tenant-name>`
- see a list of hosts: `romana show-host`, details for a specific host: `romana show-host <hostname>`

## Working with the code

This repository here contains the demo installer and documentation. The actual
source code, however, is contained in these two repositories:

* [core](https://github.com/romana/core ): A number of micro services written in Go, which comprise the core components of the Romana system.
* [networking-romana](https://github.com/romana/networking-romana): The Romana ML2 plugin an IPAM driver for OpenStack.

The READMEs of those repos contain more information about the source code and
how to run and test it.
