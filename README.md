# The Romana Project

***

## _Welcome to the Romana 2.0 preview release!_

_Romana provides cloud native, beautifully simple and natively routed network_
_traffic for Kubernetes clusters._

_You are viewing the source repository of the Romana 2.0 preview release,_
_which brings many improvements:_

* _Ability to create large Kubernetes clusters across multiple availability_
  _zones in AWS, without the need to create overlay networks, and without any_
  _limitation imposed by AWS VPC's 50 route limit._
* _Topology aware IPAM with improved, more efficient IP address and route management._
* _Improvements to Romana's internal architecture._
* _Ability to be deployed on top of kops clusters._

_Since this is a preview release, there are also still a few limitations,_
_which we are still working on for the full release:_

* _Network policies are still in the process of being ported to 2.0, so they_
  _are not included in this preview release._
* _Currently not yet fully integrated with kops, even though an installation_
  _in a kops cluster is possible, as described in our installation_
  _instructions._

_If you would like to jump straight to the Romana 2.0 specific installation_

Romana is a network and security automation solution for Cloud Native
applications. Romana automates the creation of isolated Cloud Native Networks
and secures applications with a distributed firewall that applies access
control policies consistently across all endpoints and services, wherever they
run.
